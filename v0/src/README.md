This process is straightforward, and we're here to guide you every step of the way. At certain points, we may prompt you to provide your credentials and authorize specific components.

Follow these steps:

1. Shopify Demo Data Creation:
- We'll begin by generating demo data from Shopify, covering aspects like orders, products, inventory, and customers.

2. Output Table Preparation:
- Next, we'll set up the output tables. If any columns are missing, we'll insert NULL values.
- We'll then verify the data quality and conduct an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

3. Snowflake Data Integration:
- The processed data is subsequently written back into the Snowflake database using the Snowflake data destination component.

4. Configuration for Interactive Data App:
- We'll set up the necessary configuration for the Interactive Data App.

5. Executing the Workflow:
- At this point, you'll be responsible for running the entire process. This involves executing all the previously prepared steps in their designated sequence.
- The workflow incorporates the Shopify data source component, all data manipulations, analyses, the Snowflake destination component, and the deployment of the Data App.

6. Data App Deployment & Credential Entry:
- To wrap up, the Data App will be deployed. Following this, you'll need to provide Snowflake credentials to the app.

The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to provide your credentials and authorize the destination component.

The flow, in a nutshell:

- First, we create Shopify demo data (data about orders, products, inventory, and customers).
- We then create the output tables. We add NULL values if any columns are missing. We also check the data, and perform an RFM analysis.
- The data is then written back into a Snowflake database via the Snowflake data destination component.
- The configuration for Interactive Data App is created.
- You will run the entire flow (i.e., the sequence of all the prepared, above mentioned steps, in the correct order). The Shopify data source component, all data manipulations and analyses, the Snowflake destination component, deploymnet of the Data App will be processed.
- Finnally the Data app is deployed and you will fill Snowflake credentials.
